            <p><strong>Tip 1: Prep Your Skin By Cleansing</strong><br>
            What you do before applying makeup is just as important — if not more — than finding the right formula and shade of foundation. It’s of the utmost importance to give yourself a clean, hydrated base to work with before you start doing your makeup. Always make sure to use a cleanser as the first step in your beauty routine.</p>

            <p><strong>Tip 2: Hydrate With a Moisturizer</strong><br>
            It’s a common misconception that people with oily skin don’t need to moisturize as often, or even that they shouldn’t moisturize at all. Keeping skin hydrated — yes, even for those with oily skin — and using an oil-control, matte finish primer is key to long-lasting wear. Trust us, it’s the difference between a shine-free complexion and having to touch up your T-zone every 30 minutes.</p>

            <p><strong>Tip 3: Look for Skincare Products With Hyaluronic Acid</strong><br>
            So, what type of moisturizer do you look for if you’re worried about looking like a grease ball? First of all, be on the lookout for products that say they are oil-free and non-comedogenic. A formula with hyaluronic acid, like the SkinCeuticals HA Intensifier, is recommended. "Hydration is different from moisturizing. Hydrate your complexion to balance out the oil so makeup applies better," says Rodriguez.</p>

            <p><strong>Tip 4: Primer Is Essential</strong><br>
            "Primer is your best friend when you’re trying to control shine," says Spickard. It’s the final step in prepping your skin for makeup application and it helps guarantee that your makeup will last longer, so you don’t have to reach for the blotting papers after an hour.</p>

            <p><strong>Tip 5: Don’t Forget to Prime Your Eyelids</strong><br>
            Though priming your face for complexion makeup is essential, you should also use an eye makeup primer to ensure a full face of flawless makeup that will last. This step is especially crucial if you’re wearing eyeshadow or eyeliner.</p>

    <p><strong>1. Exfoliate Your Dead Skin Cells</strong><br>
    Dry skin tends to look dull and tired because of the build-up of dead skin cells on your face. Exfoliating once or twice a week gets rid of these dry flakes, creating a smooth canvas for foundation application.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Moisturizer Is Key</strong><br>
    Use a rich and hydrating moisturizer that sinks deep into your skin to give it an instant boost of hydration. This helps retain moisture throughout the day and ensures your foundation applies smoothly.</p>

    <p><strong>1. Double-Cleanse Before Applying Makeup</strong><br>
    Start with a gentle cleansing option to purify the skin and remove impurities. Follow up with a cream cleanser to remove excess oils without stripping the skin.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Apply Water-Based Moisturizer Before Makeup</strong><br>
    Use a lightweight, mattifying moisturizer with SPF to prep your skin for the day and for makeup. A lightweight formulation is key because combo skin still needs moisture.</p>
